if you're using powershell (default for vscode), then you need to do a bit more work

first you need to enable "running scripts" on your system (read this)

you can do that with this (as admin):

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
then you can activate your venv with

.\env\Scripts\activate.ps1
